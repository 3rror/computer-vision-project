# Computer Vision project

This repository contains some small (and naive) Computer Vision algorithm
implementations as part of a university exam.

**PLEASE NOTE** the code is meant to be used as an example. It is not to be used
in production or serious applications. Also, I am a beginner in Computer Vision.

## Algorithms

* Automatic thresholding
* Edge detection through Sobel operator
* Sudoku grid and number recognizer
